# DDPG_D2C
Project to evaluate our D2C approach and compare it with DDPG

Contributers: Karthikeya S Parunandi and Ran Wang.

'karthik_branch' has DDPG setup and 'ran_branch' has the implementation of D2C. The following systems are considered as of now:
- Pendulum
- Cartpole
- Swimmer (3-link)
- Swimmer (6-link)
- Fish
- Hopper
- Cheetah

The models are taken from OpenAI gym [2] and Deepmind-Control suite[3] and then modified according to our problem.
